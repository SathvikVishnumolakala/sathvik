    "\n",
    "* When a file is opened in `text mode`, reading its data automatically decodes its content (as per the platform default or as per provided encoding), and returns it as a str; writing operation takes a str, and automatically encodes it before transferring to the file. Text mode files also support universal end-of-line translation, and encoding specification arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When a file is opened in `binary mode` by adding a `b` to the mode string argument in the open() call, reading its data does not decode it in any way, and simply returns its content raw and unchanged, as a bytes object; writing takes a bytes object and transfers it to the file unchanged. Binary-mode files also accept a bytearray object for the content to be written to the file."

    "#### 7. What qualifies ASCII text as a form of Unicode text?\n",
    "**ANS:** `Unicode` represents most written languages in the world. ASCII has its equivalent in Unicode. The difference between ASCII and Unicode is that ASCII represents lowercase letters (a-z), uppercase letters (A-Z), digits (0â€“9) and symbols such as punctuation marks while Unicode represents letters of English, Arabic, Greek etc. mathematical symbols, historical scripts, emoji covering a wide range of characters than ASCII."

    "#### 8. How much of an effect does the change in string types in Python 3.X have on your code?\n",
    "**ANS:**  Python 3 stores strings as Unicode by default whereas Python 2 requires you to mark a string with a u if you want to store it as Unicode. Unicode strings are more versatile than ASCII strings, which are the Python 3.X default, as they can store letters from foreign languages as well as emoji and the standard Roman letters and numerals."
