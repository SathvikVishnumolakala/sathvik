    "**ANS:** A programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation in the programming.\n",
    "* It helps to divide our over all program into different small segments and thus making it solving easy with the use of objects.\n",
    "* Helps in easy maintenance and modification of existing program\n",
