    "#### 1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "**ANS:** `def` statement is used to create a normal function.where as `lamba` expressions are used to create Anonymous functions.Lambda's body is a single expression and not a block of statements like def statement. The lambda expression's body is similar to what we'd put in a def body's return statement."

    "#### 2. What is the benefit of lambda?\n",
    "**ANS:** They Can be used to create Nameless/Anonymous functions inside some complex functions if we are planning to use it only once.Moderate to small functions can be created in a single line. Fuctions created using lambda expressions can be assigned to a variable and can be used by simply calling the variable."

    "* `map()`:The map() function is a type of higher-order. This function takes another function as a parameter along with a sequence of iterables and returns an output after applying the function to each iterable present in the sequence.\n",
    "* `filter()`:The filter() function is used to create an output list consisting of values for which the function returns true.\n",
    "* `reduce()`:The reduce() function, as the name describes, applies a given function to the iterables and returns a single value."

    "Annotations of simple parameters `def func(x: expression, y: expression = 20):`\n",

    "* avoid using or limited use of global variables\n",
    "* Proper Identation to increase the code readability\n",
    "* try to follow a naming convention for function names (pascalCase or camelCase) and stick with the same convention throughout the application.\n",
    "* Avoid using digits while choosing a variable name\n",
    "* try to use a name for the function which conveys the purpose of the function\n",
