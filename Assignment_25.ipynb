    "* An iterator is an object which contains a countable number of values and it is used to iterate over iterable objects like list, tuples, sets, etc. Iterators are implemented using a class.`iter()` keyword is used to create an iterator containing an iterable object`.next()` keyword is used to call the next element in the iterable object.\n",

    "#### 3) What are the signs that a function is a generator function?\n",
    "**ANS:** A generator function uses a yield statement instead of a return statement. A generator function will always return a iterable object called generator. where as a normal function can return a string/list/tuple/dict/NoneType ... etc"

    "#### 4) What is the purpose of a yield statement?\n",
    "**ANS:** The yield statement suspends functionâ€™s execution and sends a value back to the caller, but retains enough state to enable function to resume where it is left off. When resumed, the function continues execution immediately after the last yield run. This allows its code to produce a series of values over time, rather than computing them at once and sending them back like a list."

    "* List comprehension allows filtering. In map, we have no such facility.\n",
    "* List comprehension are used when a list of results is required as final output.but map only returns a map object. it needs to be explicitly coverted to desired datatype.\n",
    "* List comprehension is faster than map when we need to evaluate expressions that are too long or complicated to express\n",
